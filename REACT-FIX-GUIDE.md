# React Import Issue Fix - Deployment Guide

## Problem Summary

The "Uncaught ReferenceError: React is not defined" error occurred when deploying to AWS because several components were missing proper React imports. This is a common issue when using React 19 with the new JSX Transform.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Missing React Imports**: Components like `Button.jsx`, `Select.jsx`, `LoadingSpinner.jsx`, and `PopupComponent.jsx` were missing `import React from 'react'` statements.

2. **JSX Transform Configuration**: The Vite configuration needed explicit JSX transform settings for production builds.

3. **JSConfig Inconsistencies**: The `jsconfig.json` had duplicate entries that needed cleanup.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Vite Configuration (`vite.config.js`)
```javascript
plugins: [react({
  jsxImportSource: 'react',
  jsxRuntime: 'automatic'
})],
```

### 2. Fixed Missing React Imports
- Added `import React from 'react';` to components that were missing it
- Updated imports like `import { useState } from 'react';` to `import React, { useState } from 'react';`

### 3. Updated JSConfig (`jsconfig.json`)
- Removed duplicate entries
- Set `"jsx": "react-jsx"` for proper JSX handling

## Components Fixed
- `src/components/Button.jsx`
- `src/components/Select.jsx` 
- `src/components/LoadingSpinner.jsx`
- `src/components/PopupComponent.jsx`
- `src/components/InputField.jsx`

## Prevention Guidelines

### For Future Development:

1. **Always Import React**: Even with the new JSX Transform, explicitly import React in components:
   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';
   // or
   import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
   ```

2. **Test Production Builds Locally**: Before deploying, always run:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

3. **Use Consistent Import Patterns**: 
   - ✅ Good: `import React, { useState } from 'react';`
   - ❌ Avoid: `import { useState } from 'react';` (without React)

4. **Lint Configuration**: Consider adding ESLint rules to enforce React imports:
   ```javascript
   rules: {
     'react/react-in-jsx-scope': 'error'
   }
   ```

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to AWS:

- [ ] Run `npm run build` successfully
- [ ] Test with `npm run preview`
- [ ] Check all components have React imports
- [ ] Verify no console errors in production build
- [ ] Test all major functionality

## Build Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview

# Build and test sequence
npm run build && npm run preview
```

## Environment Notes

- **React Version**: 19.1.1
- **Vite Version**: 7.1.2
- **JSX Transform**: Automatic (React 17+ style)
- **Build Tool**: Vite with React plugin

The application now builds successfully and should deploy without the "React is not defined" error.
