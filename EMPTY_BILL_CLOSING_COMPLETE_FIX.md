# Empty Bill Closing - Complete Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
When closing empty bills (bills with no items), the success modal displayed "Payment Successful" which was misleading since no payment was actually processed.

## Root Problem
The success modal title was hardcoded as "Payment Successful" regardless of whether the bill had items or was empty.

## Solution Applied

### Frontend Changes - `src/Pages/User/Tables/TableManagement.jsx`

**1. Dynamic Modal Title**
- **Before**: Hardcoded title "Payment Successful" for all bills
- **After**: Dynamic title based on bill content:
  - Empty bills: "Bill Closed"
  - Bills with items: "Payment Successful"

**2. Code Change**
```javascript
// Before (misleading for empty bills):
showMessage(
    'Payment Successful',  // Always showed this
    successMessage,
    'success'
);

// After (appropriate for each case):
const modalTitle = isEmpty ? 'Bill Closed' : 'Payment Successful';
showMessage(
    modalTitle,  // Dynamic title
    successMessage,
    'success'
);
```
