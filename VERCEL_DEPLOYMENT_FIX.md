# Vercel Deployment Fix - URL Multiplication Issue

## Problem
The application was experiencing URL multiplication/repetition when deployed to Vercel, especially after manual refresh. The URLs would keep appending and eventually crash the browser.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by GitHub Pages specific redirect scripts in both `index.html` and `404.html` files. These scripts were designed for GitHub Pages deployment but were interfering with Vercel's routing system, causing the URL paths to be incorrectly processed and repeatedly appended.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed GitHub Pages Scripts
- Removed the SPA redirect script from `index.html`
- Simplified the `404.html` file to just redirect to homepage

### 2. Added Vercel Configuration
Created `vercel.json` with proper rewrite rules:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Updated Vite Configuration
- Added explicit `base: "/"` configuration
- Added build output directory configuration
- Ensured proper asset handling

### 4. Cleaned React Router Setup
- Removed unnecessary `basename` prop from BrowserRouter
- Ensured clean routing configuration

## Deployment Steps for Vercel

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   - Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
   - Set build command: `npm run build`
   - Set output directory: `dist`
   - The `vercel.json` will handle SPA routing automatically

3. **Environment Variables (if needed):**
   - Set `VITE_API_URL` to your Railway backend URL
   - Example: `https://your-backend.railway.app`

## Testing
After deployment:
1. Navigate to different routes
2. Manually refresh the browser on any route
3. Verify URLs remain clean and don't multiply
4. Test navigation between pages

## Key Files Modified
- `index.html` - Removed GitHub Pages scripts
- `404.html` - Simplified to basic redirect
- `vercel.json` - Added SPA routing configuration
- `vite.config.js` - Added proper base and build config
- `src/App.jsx` - Cleaned BrowserRouter configuration

This solution ensures that Vercel properly handles client-side routing for your React SPA without URL conflicts.
